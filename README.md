# Web Page Carbon Estimator ðŸŒŽ

A Chrome extension to estimate the carbon footprint of the current webpage. This is a learning project to explore web sustainability and browser extension development.

### Why
Developers don't see the carbon footprint of their work. This extension aims to make it more visible, and more of an optimisation target.

### What
This extension shows you the amount of data transferred by the website (a common problem, leading to slow sites and high carbon emissions), along with the amount of carbon this produced (powered by [CO2.js](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2-js/)!). It then compares that to driving in a car, to try to give a sense of scale.

### How (do I use it?)
1. Download the code from the Download button on [GitHub](https://github.com/hktitof/web-carbon-calculator) and unpack it into a folder.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Turn on the "Developer mode" in the top right corner. 
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button. 
5. Select the folder where you unpacked the project. 
6. You're done! The extension will now appear, ready to go, in your extensions bar.
